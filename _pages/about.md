I am a PhD candidate & Full Stack Developer in **Control Science and Engineering** in the [Lixin Tang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=qCz1I68AAAAJ)'s Lab at Northeastern University. My research is focused on the interdisciplinary fields of Process Systems Engineering, Statistics, and Robotics, with a keen interest in using **Data Analytics**, **Statistical Learning**, and **Convex Optimization** techniques to push forward scientific research.
My primary duty is to develop **Safe** and **Human-computer** data analytics models and convex optimization techniques to optimize cost, quality, energy and efficiency of **Process System**, **Bionic Robot** and **3D Printing**.&nbsp;
