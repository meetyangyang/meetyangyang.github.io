I am a PhD candidate in **Control Science and Engineering** at Northeastern University. My research is focused on the interdisciplinary fields of Process Systems Engineering, Statistics, and Robotics, with a keen interest in using **Data Analytics**, **Statistical Learning**, and **Convex Optimization** techniques to push forward scientific research.  
My primary duty is to develop **Safe** and **Human-computer** data analytics models and convex optimization techniques to optimize cost, quality, energy and efficiency of **Process Industry**, **Bionic Robot** and **3D Printing**.
