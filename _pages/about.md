I am a PhD candidate in **Control Science and Engineering** at Northeastern University. My research is focused on the interdisciplinary fields of Process Systems Engineering, Statistics, and Optimization, with a keen interest in using **Data Analytics**, **Machine Learning**, and **Convex Optimization** techniques to make world better.  
My primary responsibility is to develop safe and human-computer friendly modeling and optimization techniques to optimize cost, quality, energy and efficiency of **Autonomous Intelligent Manufacturing**, **Robot** and **Digital Twin**.
