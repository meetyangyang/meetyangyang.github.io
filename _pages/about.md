# Preventing Catastrophic AI Events: A Scientist's Duty

I am a PhD candidate in **Control Science and Engineering** in the DAO Lab at [Northeastern University（China）](http://english.neu.edu.cn/). My research is focused on the interdisciplinary fields of Process Systems Engineering（PSE）, Robotics, and AI, with a keen interest in using **data science**, **machine learning**, and **optimization** techniques to push forward scientific research. 
My primary goal is to develop **secure** and **explainable** data analytics models and convex optimization techniques to optimize energy, efficiency, and product quality of the large-scale complex process industries and their supply chains.
